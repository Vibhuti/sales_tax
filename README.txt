Brief explanation of design and assumptions:

This is a solution of Problem 2, Sales Tax. I worte it in Ruby and used Rspec and Rake for automated testing.
To give intputs, there is input.txt file exist in the folder. 

Assumptions to test solution?

1- $ cd sales_tax
2- Paste input into the input.txt file ( one by one)
3- Check output from the command line by running the command: $ ruby sales_tax.rb
4- To ensure rspec tests are working use: $ rake
5- To check it online, use this link:  http://rubyfiddle.com/riddles/48fce/7
